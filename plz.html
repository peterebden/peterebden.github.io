        <h1>Please</h1>
        
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://please.build">Please</a> is a build system I wrote for <a href="https://thoughtmachine.net">Thought Machine</a>.
It is very similar to Google's Blaze, which was a direct inspiration - the early employees at TM were mostly
ex-Googlers and we all missed it deeply. We'd all used it, because everyone there does<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">Unless you're working 100% on Android, Chromium or some similar open source project which has a separate system for building externally.</span>
</span>, although it's
fair to say Paul and I had delved in the deepest, and had the dubious honour of having broken some related
parts of Google's internal infrastructure by pushing Blaze far past the point most reasonable people would.</p>

<p>
For everyone who hasn't used Blaze, Please is functionally similar to <a href="https://bazel.io">Bazel</a>,
<a href="https://buckbuild.com">Buck</a> and <a href="https://pantsbuild.org">Pants</a>. It's probably fair to say that all
four projects have their own strengths and focuses. All four systems describe their metadata in a
similar way (a syntactical subset of Python) in files usually named <code>BUILD</code>. All four prioritise
speed, reproducibility and hermeticity. Etc.</p>

<p>
At Thought Machine, we actually started out using Gradle, of all things; at the time we had quite
a lot of Java and it seemed like a better option than anything else. We quickly fell out of love
after finding incrementality issues, abysmal performance and poor extensibility<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">Braintree have <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/migrating-from-gradle-to-bazel/">a good article</a> on this which echoes most of the problems we had better than I can here.</span>
</span>. Python was
rapidly taking over our codebase and after a bit of a survey we settled on Buck for our next step.
Some custom tweaking<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">Mostly for getting binary Python modules importing seamlessly out of the .pex files Buck would build. This could bear a future article of its own; we have a more refined system now but it is still ultimately derived from the code written four years ago, and shares the same bad jokes.</span>
</span> was required to get it working fully, but after that the deployment issues
for Python code were solved, and for a while things were going pretty well.</p>

<p>
Fast-forwarding six months or so, we were ramping up frontend development and trying to add more
technologies (notably <a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">protocol buffers</a>) on the backend. Doing
that with Buck was proving hard<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">For the curious: <a href="https://buckbuild.com/rule/genrule.html">genrule</a> only allows one output, and there is no way to access transitive dependencies during build.</span>
</span> without modifying Buck's own Java code, which none of us were
desperately keen on doing. A high-level design meeting<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">At the pub one evening, which is a traditional site of British innovation.</span>
</span> was held where we decided that we could
solve this ourselves and recited the traditional engineering mantras of "how hard can it be" and
"what could possibly go wrong".</p>


<h2>Conception</h2>
<p>At this point we had decided to go for it, and so the first priority was coming up with a name. We
rapidly<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">There was actually another name proposed first, but we all liked Please better, and it's subsequently been lost to the mists of time.</span>
</span> settled on Please, mostly because we like to sound polite which "please build" and
"please test" fitted well, and the obvious abbreviation to <code>plz</code> is nice for a command-line tool.
The domain was registered on the spot and we moved on to the next question: what language should
it be written in?</p>

<p>
<img src="merchants-tavern.jpg" align=right alt="The site of conception"></p>

<p>
We solved that one by a process of elimination. Roughly, our thoughts were:
<ul>
<li><b>Python</b>: too slow, poor multithreading support.</li>
<li><b>C</b>: too low-level, nearly nothing built in.</li>
<li><b>C++</b>: too complex, I was the only one who really knew (or liked) it.</li>
<li><b>Java</b>: the JVM is awfully suboptimal for a command-line tool.</li>
<li><b>Rust</b>: too young<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">At this point we are still in 2015, pre Rust 1.0.</span>
</span>, probably more complex than we need.</li>
<li><b>Go</b>: Great parallelism, native binaries, strong libraries.</li>
</ul>
Of course, the grand total of lines of Go written by any of us present was actually zero. But
we didn't let that stop us<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">Because of the aforementioned mantras.</span>
</span> and early<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">Earlyish.</span>
</span> the next morning I got a good strong cup of coffee,
set up the new repository, rolled up my sleeves and started writing and learning Go at roughly
equal rates.</p>

<p>
Obviously it took a little while to get the nascent Please to a point where it was actually
useful - but rather gratifyingly, that was faster than I expected. The time needed to become
productive with Go was shockingly short and despite some failed experimentation initially<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">Some fiddling on how best to handle our complex command-line flag setup (tl;dr: the standard <code>flags</code> package wasn't up to it, <a href="https://github.com/jessevdk/go-flags/">go-flags</a> is amazing) and a lot of time sunk into failed parser experiments, which really deserves an article of its own.</span>
</span>
it was self-hosting after only a couple of months and a little later was very nearly a drop-in
replacement to our main repo.</p>

<p>
The whole undertaking didn't really meet with 100% approval from Paul, our CEO; in fact various
dire threats were uttered in between telling us to "get on with our work" and "stop messing
around with the build system". Fortunately in the end nobody was actually fired and the company
settled down on plz very quickly.</p>


<h2>Design</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, Please is (very) strongly inspired by Blaze. The concepts of correct
incrementality, cross-language builds, extensibility and strong support for stitching in arbitrary
build actions all seemed pretty obvious in hindsight, although the specific syntax used is
more directly mimicked - but of course, if it ain't broke...</p>

<p>
An obvious trade-off in the design was the requirement of describing the build metadata very
explicitly in BUILD files. This certainly does put more onus on developers to specify their
requirements than other systems might - for example, <code>go build</code> extracts its information from
the source files (although it includes some build directives as syntactic comments, such as
build tags and cgo instructions, so in a real sense some build metadata really is still necessary).
At the end of the day it doesn't take long to write BUILD files and it's then easy for the system
and other developers to understand what's going on. Retaining a relentless focus on the build
process being able to generate everything also avoids manual steps - for example, we use
<a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">Protocol Buffers</a> and <a href="https://grpc.io">gRPC</a> extensively
to generate client code for various languages, but the versions seen by the compiled code are
always up-to-date, there is never any requirement for developers to rebuild and check in the
generated code<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">Checking in generated code is always a suboptimal and pernicious thing, and to be avoided where possible.</span>
</span>.</p>

<p>
<img src="foundation.jpg" align=left alt="A novel with a very dubious connection to the topic at hand."></p>

<p>
We did make a very clear decision early on, that the core system would remain agnostic to the
peculiarities of specific languages, and all the information about how to build them would itself
be written in the BUILD language. This serves twin goals - first, that it's possible to extend to
new languages dynamically since there is nothing special about the builtin ones, and secondly
that we simply didn't have enough resource to do it the other way - writing hundreds of thousands
of lines<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">Buck was approximately 150,000 lines at the time; Bazel wasn't open sourced until a bit later but was even bigger. Please was around 5000 lines at v1.0, plus a couple of thousand lines of the still-unnamed build language. It's bigger now, of course, but still much smaller than the others.</span>
</span> would have been beyond the little resource we had<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">Any resemblance to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_%28Asimov_novel%29">the Foundation</a> is of course totally coincidental.</span>
</span>.</p>

<p>
Of course, a lot of the design was driven by the needs of Thought Machine; the nature of the
product we were building and the industry we were in made the values we focused on particularly
important. Just try telling someone used to working with highly verified software in a regulated
environment that your open source policy is to run <code>npm install</code> and you don't really know how
many copies of <code>is-odd</code> turn up...
As well as that, we were also designing for the long term. We always had faith in the company's
success, which meant future growth, and so we knew we'd need something to scale to tens or
hundreds of developers - which requires a different set of tradeoffs to the setup you'd have for
a small handful working with a smaller set of technologies.</p>


<h2>Evolution</h2>
<p>Please has come a long way since its version 1 all that time ago. We've added a lot of features,
streamlined and optimised many things. Obviously these have primarily been driven by requirements
from inside Thought Machine and contributors on Github, but we've always taken care to stay true
to the original design principles, even when it's tempting to cut some corners.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, being able to jump in and code up features our developers need is always great.
For example, a long time back we added the ability to define custom command aliases, so that
typing <code>plz deploy</code> will build and run a custom command. Subsequently this has been used
extensively for many tools that our devs use, to the point where it seems most of the commands
we need to run these days begin with <code>plz</code>. We've extended the same feature in Please to add
better help and tab completion, none of which was ever remotely on the roadmap originally.</p>

<p>
Another interesting example has been sandboxing; some time back, we were having issues with our
build machines coming under heavy load. After some investigation, one reason for that was that
there were many tests requesting to start within Docker containers, and digging further into them
it transpired that they were nearly all using them to get network segregation to avoid port clashes.
Replacing nearly all of them with a custom sandbox that segregates network, process and IPC
namespaces proved a lot lighter weight and spared our poor much-suffering build agents - as well
as identifying a couple of tests that were unintentionally making outbound network requests.</p>


<h2>Current state</h2>
<p>Please is open source, under the Apache licence; you can <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please">check it out on Github</a>
or learn more on <a href="https://please.build">the website</a>. There are instructions for installing
binary versions, or it's pretty easy to build from scratch; you just need Go installed.</p>

<p>
It works fully on Linux (we mostly test on Ubuntu but it should be pretty distro-agnostic) and OSX.
FreeBSD has been known to work in the past although we've not checked in a long time.</p>

<p>
Some of the topics here bear deeper dives of their own, but for now this should give a bit of
a flavour of the general system, and what exactly I was thinking when I started all this...</p>
