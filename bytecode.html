        <h1>A Tale of Two (or three) Bytecodes</h1>
        
<h2>Builds & non-determinism</h2>
<p>One of the things we're keen on at work is deterministic builds; our
<a href="https://please.build">build system</a> caches based on file hashes so if outputs
change arbitrarily that causes people to have to rebuild things they shouldn't -
and in the limiting case, run tests that they didn't have to.</p>

<p>
A few months ago a couple of us spotted a case where we were getting different
results from one of the build servers, and started digging in to investigate.
In the end it took a few hours and a deep dive through some of CPython's
internals to figure out what was going on.</p>


<h2>Python bytecode</h2>
<p>As we all know, Python is primarily an interpreted language, but the most
common implementations compile the source into bytecode before executing.
This article is primarily about CPython 3 but the same principles might (or
might not) apply to others<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">PyPy certainly has bytecode, but I've not tested if it exhibits the behaviour described here. Python 2 differs in some minor details but who cares about that now anyway.</span>
</span> as well.</p>

<p>
Python saves the bytecode files in a <code>__pycache__</code> subdirectory which is an
optimisation to save it from re-parsing the files later on. We do the same at
build time and wrap that up into the <a href="https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex">pex</a>
files that we deploy.</p>

<p>
After a little bit of fiddling, we determined that the pex files were differing
in one of the <code>.pyc</code> files in it - and it was one corresponding to one of our
source files, but only one out of several hundred. What was going on?</p>


<h2>Bytecode structure</h2>
<p><a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200804/the_structure_of_pyc_files.html">This</a> is
a good explanation of the structure of bytecode files. Briefly, up until Python
3.6, they look like this:</p>

<p>
<pre>
------------------------------------------
|         |        |        |            |
0  magic  4  time  8  size  12  code...  |
|         |        |        |            |
------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p>
The first 4 bytes contain a magic number to identify the file and help detect
some encoding errors. The second four byte word contains the modification timestamp
of the file, then the third its size. These are used to determine whether the
bytecode matches the input file or not.</p>

<p>
Obviously, embedding a timestamp is never deterministic, but we found that a long
time ago and have code to identify & zero that, so we knew that wasn't the problem.</p>

<p>
In Python 3.7, the fantastic <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0552/">PEP-552</a> has
changed the format in order to allow a fully deterministic format. It looks like this:</p>

<p>
<pre>
---------------------------------------------------------
|         |         |              |        |           |
0  magic  4  flags  8  validation  12 size  16 code...  |
|         |         |              |        |           |
---------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
The PEP describes the changes, but briefly the flags field defines how the file should
be validated, and the following field contains the thing to check against (either a hash
or a timestamp). Hence if hash verification is used there are no timestamps to worry
about so everything should be deterministic. For the rest of this article we'll use
this method to avoid any false positives from the timestamps.</p>


<h2>Differences</h2>
<p>So we knew which files were different, but they were exactly the same size, and
comparing them side-by-side showed only a few differences in one part of the file.
Fortunately Python bytecode is pretty rich and it's possible to link that back to
the original source locations, and we found the culprit boiled down to something like:
<pre>
def test(x):
    if x in {'ONE', 'TWO', 'THREE'}:
        pass
</pre>
The error obviously occurred on the second line - so what's so special about it?
We have lots of if statements and set literals all over our codebase, why is this
one giving difficulty?</p>

<p>
Before we dig in any deeper, it's pretty easy to prove that this really is a thing
using the sample given above:
<pre>
$ python3.7 -m compileall --invalidation-mode=unchecked-hash test.py
Compiling 'test.py'...
$ sha1sum __pycache__/test.cpython-37.pyc
61e5682ca95e8707b4ef2a79f64566664dafd800  __pycache__/test.cpython-37.pyc
$ rm __pycache__/test.cpython-37.pyc
$ python3.7 -m compileall --invalidation-mode=unchecked-hash test.py
Compiling 'test.py'...
$ sha1sum __pycache__/test.cpython-37.pyc
222a06621b491879e5317b34e9dd715bacd89b7d  __pycache__/test.cpython-37.pyc
$ rm __pycache__/test.cpython-37.pyc
$ python3.7 -m compileall --invalidation-mode=unchecked-hash test.py
Compiling 'test.py'...
$ sha1sum __pycache__/test.cpython-37.pyc
0cf106f696caa6dec81e333597b416bc1cda6475  __pycache__/test.cpython-37.pyc
</pre>
Your results might vary a little, since it's nondeterministic; but trying it a
few times pretty easily produces two different hashes.</p>


<h2>hexl-mode</h2>

<p>
That probably looks a bit like a game of Spot the Difference, but
fortunately our carefully-chosen string constants stick out like a sore
thumb as being in a different order<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">In the actual original case, these were integer enums so it took us a bit longer to figure out what was going on.</span>
</span>.</p>

<p>
So at this point we remember that Python sets are not ordered and
so it seems not totally surprising that they are coming out differently.
Except that, as I mentioned before, this is far from the only set literal
in our codebase and we don't see this effect from any others. For example,
the following code does <em>not</em> generate the same nondeterminism:
<pre>
x = {'ONE', 'TWO', 'THREE'}
</pre>
On the bright side, we have a fix; setting <code>PYTHONHASHSEED=42</code><span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">Or any value really, but why would we use anything other than the Answer when given an opportunity?</span>
</span> while
running our <code>compile_all</code> step will produce the same output every time.
And indeed this was how we fixed the issue, but at that point our
intellectual curiosity was well beyond fixing the actual problem.</p>


<h2>Peepholes</h2>
<p>So after some digging through the CPython source<span class="fnrel">
<sup><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>
<span class="footnote" style="display:none">CPython isn't trivial, but the source is really very readable - it's worth having a look and trying to understand, it's by no means an impenetrable black box.</span>
</span> with the help of a
local debug build, it turns out that the values in a set literal are loaded
as a tuple. In the bytecode this is a series of <code>LOAD_CONST</code> instructions
(one for each value). However if we look at the nondeterministic example,
it only has one <code>LOAD_CONST</code> which is followed by a <code>frozenset</code> object.
What's happened here?</p>

<p>
After a bit more code spelunking, this turns out to be an optimisation
applied by CPython. There is what's called a "peephole optimiser", which
is a term for a local optimiser in a compiler that recognises specific
local patterns which can be turned into a more optimal form. These are
pretty common since they're very fast to run, relatively easy to write
and can give a nice speedup on appropriate code. Conversely, more
powerful techniques may require further-reaching changes - for example,
inlining a function can provide a great performance boost, but it's hard
to do without e.g. breaking stacktraces or other subtle semantics.</p>

<p>
This particular peephole optimisation knows about set literals and when
they're in a context where the set will not be used again will optimise to
an immutable <code>frozenset</code>. This obviously can't be done for most set
literals since it can't prove that they won't be changed later on. So
this explains why we only get it in this limited scope and why it was so
rare in our codebase - it's just not common to write a constant set literal
in that kind of context.</p>


<h2>Resolution?</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, setting <code>PYTHONHASHSEED</code> to a known value works around
the issue, which is indeed what we did. At the time I didn't think it
really counted as a bug since (also as mentioned) the bytecode in Python 3.6
wasn't actually deterministic anyway because of the timestamps in it,
but in the post-PEP 552 world it might be. For now it's
<a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue34722">logged upstream</a> so hopefully in
a future version we'll no longer have to worry.</p>
